# Gate Ledger Template

Copy this file for each phase or artifact gate, for example:

- `review/gates/phase_03_draft_plan.GATE.md`
- `review/gates/phase_04_draft.GATE.md`
- `review/gates/phase_08_revision.GATE.md`

Do not proceed to the next section or phase until the relevant gate file passes
`scripts/check_gate.py`.

## Required Machine-Readable Block

Use one key-value block per artifact. Keep field names unchanged.

**Several artifacts in one file:** separate the blocks with a `---` line (the parser also
starts a new block at every top-level `artifact:` key, so blocks never merge). Each block
is verified on its own — a `citation: FAIL` in one block is never masked by a `PASS` in
another. When a file holds more than one block, `check_gate.py` **requires `--artifact`**
to select the block to verify and fails loudly otherwise. Artifact paths compare
slash-insensitively (`drafts\05_results.md` matches `drafts/05_results.md`).

```yaml
phase: Phase 4 - Draft Sections
artifact: drafts/05_results.md
status: PASS              # PASS | FAIL
checks:
  constraint: PASS
  citation: PASS
  numbers: PASS
  logic: PASS
provenance:               # sha256 of the state this PASS was earned against
  artifact: 0d6f...e3a1   # py scripts\check_gate.py --compute-hash drafts\05_results.md
  evidence: 7b2c...90ff   # sha256 of knowledge/evidence.md at verify time
  results: a14e...c8d2    # sha256 of the results CSV the numbers were traced to
round: 2                  # max 2 fix/re-verify attempts
blocking_failures: none
verifier_model: opus
timestamp: 2026-06-18T10:30:00+09:00
```

> Note: `check_gate.py` parses `status`, `artifact`, `round`, the `checks.*` keys, and the

## Freshness / Provenance (stale-gate guard)

A PASS is only valid for the artifact state it was earned against. Without this, a
section can pass the gate, then be edited (e.g. to fix one verifier's finding), and the
old PASS silently survives — its numbers or citations no longer re-checked. This is the
main risk once the four verifiers run **in parallel**: a fix applied after a co-verifier
already returned PASS leaves that PASS stale.

Mechanism:

1. When the gate passes, record the sha256 of each source-of-truth file under `provenance:`.
   Compute hashes with the built-in helper:

   ```powershell
   py scripts\check_gate.py --compute-hash drafts\05_results.md
   ```

2. At gate-check time, re-hash and compare with `--verify-hash LABEL=PATH` (repeatable). A
   changed file fails the gate as a **stale gate**, forcing re-verification:

   ```powershell
   py scripts\check_gate.py review\gates\phase_04_draft.GATE.md --artifact drafts\05_results.md --require-check constraint --require-check citation --require-check numbers --require-check logic --verify-hash artifact=drafts\05_results.md
   ```

The `--verify-hash` flag is opt-in at the **tool** level (omit it and the gate behaves exactly as
before — backward compatible). At the **workflow** level it is **standard practice**: the section
and revision gate commands below include `--verify-hash`, so a PASS that no longer matches its
source files fails as stale. Record `provenance.artifact` on every PASS. Also record and verify
`provenance.evidence` (`knowledge/evidence.md`) for citation-bearing gates and `provenance.results`
(the relevant CSV) for numbers-bearing gates. For revision (Phase 8) gates evidence/results are
**required** — a revision round routinely changes the upstream sources a prior PASS depended on.

## Required Check Names

Use these exact keys so `check_gate.py --require-check <name>` can verify them:

| Check key | Source |
|---|---|
| `constraint` | Constraint-Compliance verifier |
| `citation` | `scripts/check_citations.py` plus semantic citation verifier when needed |
| `numbers` | `scripts/check_numbers.py` |
| `logic` | Logic/redundancy verifier |
| `revision_claims` | `scripts/check_revision_claims.py` |
| `response_alignment` | reviewer response vs manuscript alignment verifier |

## Cross-Check (the ledger must match reality)

`--require-check` only proves the ledger *says* `PASS`. For the deterministic
dimensions (`citation`, `numbers`, `revision_claims`) the gate can go further and
**re-run the canonical checker live**, then assert the recorded status agrees. This
catches a stale or fabricated `checks.citation: PASS` — one recorded without actually
running the checker, or left behind after the artifact changed under it. **A live FAIL
fails the gate regardless of the ledger** — a broken artifact cannot pass even if the
ledger honestly records FAIL — and a ledger that disagrees with a live PASS (stale
ledger) fails too.

`--cross-check LABEL=PATH` names the dimension and the artifact to re-check.
`--evidence` / `--results` point the live citation/number checks at their sources
(defaults `knowledge\evidence.md`, `results\`). A live checker that cannot run
(missing sources) fails **loudly**, never silently passes. The flag is opt-in at the
tool level (backward compatible) but **standard practice** at the workflow level — the
gate commands below include it.

## Command Examples

Draft section gate (freshness + cross-check — `results` because this section carries numbers):

```powershell
py scripts\check_gate.py review\gates\phase_04_draft.GATE.md --artifact drafts\05_results.md --require-check constraint --require-check citation --require-check numbers --require-check logic --verify-hash artifact=drafts\05_results.md --verify-hash results=results\table2_outcomes.csv --cross-check citation=drafts\05_results.md --cross-check numbers=drafts\05_results.md --results results
```

Revision gate (evidence + results freshness required — a revision round changes both):

```powershell
py scripts\check_gate.py review\gates\phase_08_revision.GATE.md --require-check constraint --require-check revision_claims --require-check response_alignment --require-check citation --require-check numbers --verify-hash artifact=drafts\revision\REV1\05_results_REV1.md --verify-hash evidence=knowledge\evidence.md --verify-hash results=results\table2_outcomes.csv --cross-check revision_claims=drafts\revision\REV1\response_letter_REV1.md
```

## FAIL Example

```yaml
phase: Phase 4 - Draft Sections
artifact: drafts/06_discussion.md
status: FAIL
checks:
  constraint: PASS
  citation: FAIL
  numbers: PASS
  logic: FAIL
round: 2
blocking_failures: unsupported citation in paragraph 3; repeated Results sentence in Discussion
verifier_model: opus
timestamp: 2026-06-18T11:10:00+09:00
```
