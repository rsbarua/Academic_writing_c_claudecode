A structured workflow system for academic medical paper writing using Claude AI.

## Version

**v1.6.4** (2026-08-30)

[![tests](https://github.com/grotyx/Academic_writing_c_claudecode/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/grotyx/Academic_writing_c_claudecode/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

---

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive framework for writing academic medical papers with Claude AI assistance. It includes:

- **Structured project organization** for manuscripts, data, and references
- **Multi-paper project support** with per-paper subfolder organization
- **File versioning system** (date-based default, _v1, _REV1 styles)
- **Revision workflow** with dedicated revision folders and file naming
- **Expert team simulation** (Clinical Expert, Methodology Expert, Statistician, Editor)
- **Statistical analysis workflow** with Python script generation
- **Quality control procedures** with minimum 3-round verification (6 rounds recommended) plus revision QC re-run workflow
- **Study-type specific checklists** (STROBE, CONSORT, PRISMA, CARE, etc.)
- **Natural Academic Writing Style system** with Style Reference Tables (Voice/Tense, Transition Words, Verb Upgrades, Common Corrections, Statistical Notation, Hedging Language) and Writing Principles (Clarity/Conciseness/Objectivity/Consistency)
- **Reliable style transformation** (`/style-pass`) — convert a rough draft to a bound journal style: a per-project Style Spec (one chosen exemplar) + section-by-section transform + an independent Style-Conformance verifier (auto-fix loop) + a measurable `scripts/check_style.py` gate (sentence length, citation density, hedging) + auto-trigger on "make it academic" intent (`docs/style_transform_protocol.md`)
- **Citation quality control** — Claim→Citation Mapping (20 key claims mapped to citations before writing starts; prevents write-first, cite-later)
- **Style anchor library** (`Style/`) — own, landmark, and target-journal anchors for terminology, tone, framing, and house style
- **Terminology registry** (`Style/terminology.md`) — preferred/forbidden terms with definitions and context
- **Drafting protocol** (`docs/drafting_protocol.md`) — outline → evidence-bound draft → style pass → QC
- **Manuscript linting** (`scripts/lint_manuscript.py`) — automated checks for terminology, placeholders, overclaiming, and section-specific issues
- **Citation evidence checking** (`scripts/check_citations.py`) — verifies `[EVID:id]` tags against `knowledge/evidence.md`
- **Data number checking** (`scripts/check_numbers.py`) — verifies manuscript/table numbers against `results/*.csv`
- **Phase gate ledger checking** (`scripts/check_gate.py`) — blocks progression unless `review/gates/*.GATE.md` records required PASS checks
- **Gate freshness / provenance** (`scripts/check_gate.py --verify-hash`) — records a sha256 of the verified artifact (and evidence/results) on PASS; a later edit makes the gate **stale** and forces re-verification, closing the parallel-verifier hole
- **Gate cross-check** (`scripts/check_gate.py --cross-check`) — re-runs the canonical checker live for the deterministic dimensions (`citation` / `numbers` / `revision_claims`) and fails the gate when the ledger's recorded status disagrees, catching a stale or fabricated `PASS` (loud-fails if a source is unreachable)
- **Revision claim checking** (`scripts/check_revision_claims.py`) — verifies response-letter `[CHANGE]` claims against revised manuscript files
- **LLM verifier prompt templates** (`docs/verifier_prompt_templates.md`) — structured prompts for constraint, semantic-citation, data, logic/redundancy, style-conformance, citation-stance, and revision-alignment checks
- **Citation assist** — `/suggest-citation` (find the best `[EVID:id]` for a claim), `/verify-claims` (per-sentence SUPPORTED/PARTIAL/UNSUPPORTED claim map via `scripts/extract_claims.py`), `/cite-stance` (supporting/contrasting/mentioning, Scite-style), and `/evidence-table` (a "summary of included studies" table via `scripts/evidence_table.py`, Elicit-style) (`docs/citation_assist_protocol.md`)
- **Knowledge-graph integration** (optional) — the medical-kag MCP (GraphRAG) as an upstream discovery / conflict / GRADE-synthesis / reference engine, with `knowledge/evidence.md` kept canonical and `scripts/search_pubmed.py` as the fallback (`docs/medical_kag_protocol.md`)
- **Process-enforcement hooks** (`scripts/hooks/`) — SessionStart contract injection, PreToolUse plan-first gate, PostToolUse style/terminology lint, and UserPromptSubmit style auto-trigger
- **One-shot verification** (`/verify`, `scripts/verify_all.py`) — runs citation + number + gate checks together
- **Author response DOCX generation** (`scripts/compile_response_docx.py`) — converts DOCX-ready Markdown to the `Author_response_220803_Final.docx` house style
- **Author response Markdown template** (`docs/response_letter_template.md`) — keeps reviewer responses, manuscript locations, and machine-readable `[CHANGE]` blocks aligned
- **Draft plan template** (`docs/draft_plan_template.md`) — 10-item template with claim→citation tables and approval checklist
- **PubMed search tool** with built-in Python script (no MCP or external packages required)
- **Co-author debate** (`/paper-debate`) — pre-writing Claude–Codex discussion for analysis plans, draft plans, argument structure, and reviewer responses (`docs/debate_protocol.md`)
- **Multi-model critical review** (`/critical-review`) — post-writing adversarial review at senior reviewer/editor level via Claude subagent, Codex, and/or OpenRouter models, ranked by consensus × severity (`docs/critical_review_protocol.md`)
- **Editorial desk-screen** (`/editor-review`) — a high-impact-journal editor's substantive call beyond mechanical QC: identifies the paper's field, benchmarks it against what that field's high-impact journals actually publish, and judges clinical validity, scope fit, and analysis adequacy — then a `SEND FOR PEER REVIEW` / `BORDERLINE` / `DESK REJECT` verdict with what to add to compete (or a realistic lower-tier journal). Single Opus subagent or multi-model panel; optional medical-kag benchmark (`docs/critical_review_protocol.md` §5)
- **AI-Draft De-bloat** — writing-guide pass that strips AI tells (hollow `-ing` analysis, AI vocabulary, signposting) so disclosed AI assistance still reads naturally (`docs/writing_guide.md`)
- **Slash commands** for evidence registration (`/search-evidence`, `/import-doi`)

## Quick Start

1. **Setup**: Update `CLAUDE.md` with your research topic, target journal, and study design. Check `profile/journals.md` for citation format and `Style/` for style anchors.
2. **References**: Use `/search-evidence [query]` or `py scripts\search_pubmed.py` to search PubMed and register in `knowledge/evidence.md`
3. **Data Analysis**: Place data in `data/` folder → create `analysis_plan.md` (required) → run statistical analysis
4. **Draft Plan**: Copy `docs/draft_plan_template.md` → `drafts/draft_plan.md`, fill in all 10 items including **Claim→Citation Mapping** (Opus recommended)
5. **Drafting**: Follow `docs/drafting_protocol.md` and write sections in recommended order (Methods → Results → Introduction → Discussion)
6. **Verification gates**: Run citation, number, phase-gate, and revision-claim checks; record PASS in `review/gates/`
7. **Revision response**: Use `docs/response_letter_template.md` and compile with `scripts/compile_response_docx.py` when reviewer responses are needed
8. **QC**: Run minimum 3 QC rounds before submission
9. **Finalize**: Compile manuscript to DOCX (see `docs/docx_guide.md`)

## Key Features

### Expert Team Simulation

- **Dr. Researcher A**: Clinical perspective (Introduction, Discussion)
- **Dr. Researcher B**: Methodology (Methods, Results, Tables)
- **Dr. Statistician**: Statistical validation, parsimony, MCID/NNT assessment
- **Dr. Editor**: Final polish, consistency check

### Mandatory Planning Before Writing

- **Analysis Plan** (`data/analysis_plan.md`): Required before any statistical analysis — defines research questions, endpoints, and test selection
- **Draft Plan** (`drafts/draft_plan.md`): Required before any section drafting — 10 required items including key message, tone/voice, essential references, evidence gaps, **Claim→Citation Mapping**, table/figure plan, and section outlines
- Both plans require user approval before proceeding to the next phase
- Per-paper plans for multi-paper projects

### Claim→Citation Mapping (NEW in v0.7.0)

A pre-writing step in the draft plan that maps ~20 key claims to their supporting citations before any writing begins:

- **Introduction background**: 5–8 claims (epidemiology, prior evidence)
- **Methods rationale**: 2–3 claims (why this outcome measure, why this design)
- **Discussion comparisons**: 5–8 claims (how findings compare to prior work)

If a citation cannot be identified for a claim, go back to Phase 1 and search first. This eliminates the write-first, cite-later anti-pattern and hallucinated references.

### Style Anchor Library (`Style/`)

Style anchors are separated from reference management. Source PDFs stay under `Style/PDF/` and extracted style notes are stored under `Style/own/`, `Style/landmark/`, or `Style/target_journal/`.
A template is provided at `Style/own/example_YYYY_Journal_keyword.md`.

Each summary captures:

- Field-specific terminology (correct vs incorrect)
- Methods boilerplate patterns (reusable text)
- Key claims with exact data (ready for cross-citation)
- Tone and voice consistency across papers

### Model Selection by Phase

- **Opus recommended**: Analysis Plan, Draft Plan, Revision — strategic decisions that determine paper quality
- **Sonnet default (Opus if budget allows)**: Drafting, Style Polish, QC — plan-guided execution
- Core principle: "Plan with Opus → Write with Sonnet"

### Redundancy Prevention

- Avoid triple duplication (Results text + Table + Figure)
- Clear guidelines for Table vs Figure decision
- Standard table structure (Table 1: Demographics, Table 2: Main Results)

### Statistical Analysis Guide (v0.3.0)

- Statistical Parsimony — RCT Table 1 without p-values
- Analysis Hierarchy — Primary > Secondary > Exploratory
- Clinical Significance — Effect size, MCID, NNT
- Subgroup Analysis Rules — Interaction test required
- Non-significant Results Reporting Guide

### Quality Control (6 Rounds)

- Round 1: Number consistency
- Round 2: Reference verification (+ order of appearance, placeholder detection, format consistency, citation distribution)
- Round 3: Logic and flow
- Round 4: Terminology, abbreviation, and tense consistency
- Round 5: Statistical quality
- Round 6: Critical review (overclaiming, logical fallacy, bias, generalizability) — internal experts plus optional external multi-model `/critical-review`

### Verification Harness

The harness combines deterministic checks with constrained LLM verifier prompts:

- `scripts/check_citations.py` verifies every `[EVID:id]` citation against `knowledge/evidence.md` and fails unverified or unknown evidence.
- `scripts/check_numbers.py` verifies manuscript and table numbers against `results/*.csv`.
- `scripts/check_gate.py` verifies that phase gate ledgers contain `status: PASS` and required checks.
- `scripts/check_revision_claims.py` verifies reviewer-response `[CHANGE]` blocks against revised manuscript files.
- `docs/verifier_prompt_templates.md` provides structured prompts for semantic support, logic, redundancy, and revision-response alignment.

### Co-author Collaboration (NEW in v0.9.3)

Two complementary Codex/multi-model features bracket the writing process:

- **`/paper-debate <topic>`** — *before* writing. Claude and Codex act as co-authors and debate analysis approach, draft-plan key message, argument structure, or reviewer-response strategy across bounded rounds (consensus cap 3). The debate log is saved under `review/debates/` and the agreed conclusion feeds the next produce step. Falls back to Claude-solo if Codex is unavailable. See `docs/debate_protocol.md`.
- **`/critical-review <target>`** — *after* writing. The finished manuscript (or response letter) is attacked in parallel by any combination of a fresh Claude subagent, Codex, and OpenRouter models (default `minimax/minimax-m3`, `z-ai/glm-5.2`). Each reviewer is prompted at **senior peer-reviewer / editor-in-chief level** — pushing past surface defects to design soundness, whether the data support the conclusions, and publication-worthiness. Findings are merged and ranked by **consensus × severity** (Critical / Important / Minor) and stored under `review/critical/`. See `docs/critical_review_protocol.md`.

The adversarial prompts live as a single source under `scripts/critical_prompts/` (`manuscript.txt`, `response.txt`); the OpenRouter script, the Claude subagent, and Codex all read the same files. OpenRouter access uses `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (set in `.claude/settings.local.json`, gitignored); when absent, OpenRouter is skipped and the other reviewers proceed.

### AI-Draft De-bloat (NEW in v0.9.3)

A `docs/writing_guide.md` pass (applied in Phase 5 for AI-written drafts) that removes the tells of AI prose — hollow `-ing` "surface analysis" clauses, AI-favored vocabulary, and over-signposting — while explicitly **excluding** patterns that legitimately conflict (necessary hedging, copula, passive voice). AI authorship is still disclosed; this only keeps disclosed assistance from reading as bloated and tedious.

### Verification Hardening (NEW in v1.0.0)

Improvements adapted from the "superpowers" skills framework, focused on the verification gate:

- **Parallel verifiers + Constraint-first.** The four section-gate verifiers (Constraint / Citation / Data / Logic) are dispatched concurrently against a frozen artifact; the artifact is not edited mid-verification, and on FAIL the Constraint (spec-compliance) findings are fixed first. See `docs/verification_protocol.md` (v0.3.0).
- **Gate freshness / provenance** (`scripts/check_gate.py`). On PASS the gate ledger records a sha256 of the verified artifact (and `evidence` / `results` for citation- and numbers-bearing gates; required for revision). `check_gate.py --verify-hash LABEL=PATH` re-hashes and fails the gate as **stale** if the file changed since the PASS — closing the hole where a post-PASS edit silently survives re-checking. `--compute-hash PATH` fills the provenance fields. Opt-in at the tool level, standard in the documented gate commands.
- **STOP signals.** A CLAUDE.md anti-rationalization table catches the human-level shortcuts the verifiers can't ("this number is probably fine" → check the CSV; "I already passed" → a changed artifact is stale).
- **Socratic draft-plan brainstorming.** A "Step 0" in `docs/draft_plan_template.md` sharpens the paper's intent one question at a time before the plan is filled — distinct from `/paper-debate`, which it feeds as R0 prep.
- **Reviewer-response triage.** `docs/revision_guide.md` assigns each reviewer comment an accept / partial / rebut posture, mapped to the `[CHANGE]` marker and the ghost-revision gate.
- **Command `use-when` guidance.** Each `.claude/commands/*.md` now declares the situation that should trigger it.

### Author Response DOCX Workflow

Reviewer responses should be drafted in `docs/response_letter_template.md` format, with each manuscript edit recorded as a `[CHANGE]` block. Final response letters can be compiled with:

```powershell
py scripts\compile_response_docx.py drafts\revision\REV1\response_letter_REV1.md
```

The compiler reproduces the `Author_response_220803_Final.docx` house style — Times New Roman 11 pt, with bold response / location / revised-text lines and a justified body. It does not read that .docx file as a template; the formatting is built in.

### PubMed Search Tool

Built-in Python script (`scripts/search_pubmed.py`) for reference search without MCP:

```bash
py scripts\search_pubmed.py search "endoscopic spine surgery"  # Search
py scripts\search_pubmed.py fetch 35486828                     # Import by PMID
py scripts\search_pubmed.py doi 10.1016/j.spinee.2023.01.005  # Import by DOI
py scripts\search_pubmed.py related 35486828                   # Related articles
```

Slash commands for Claude integration:

- `/search-evidence [query]` - Search, select, and register in evidence.md
- `/import-doi [doi]` - Import by DOI and register in evidence.md

## Changelog

### v1.6.4 (2026-08-30)

**Full harness review (Claude Fable) — 16 defects fixed, 33 regression tests**

- **Gate false-PASS / false-FAIL / crash (HIGH):** `check_citations.py` now FAILs malformed or non-ASCII `[EVID:…]` tags (`o'brien_2021`, `müller_2020`) instead of silently reporting PASS with 0 tokens; `search_pubmed.py` slugifies generated ids and uses the full last name. `check_numbers.py`: a ragged results-CSV row no longer crashes the gate; manuscript `p<0.001` matches a CSV cell `<0.001` (same or looser bound); uppercase `P<0.05` is a p-comparison; spine-level / code-style suffixes (`L4-5`, `C5-6`, `COVID-19`, `ICD-10`) are structural, not results; ROUND_HALF_UP accepted alongside banker's rounding (2.675 → 2.68).
- **Enforcement actually on across platforms:** hooks run via new `scripts/hooks/run.sh` (`py` if present, else `python3`) — previously every hook exited 127 on macOS/Linux and Rule 7/8 was silently off. `enforce_gates.py` now also rejects a plan with *no* approval checkbox (Rule 9 wording was not enforced).
- **`check_gate.py`:** artifact paths compared slash-insensitively (`drafts\05_results.md` == `drafts/05_results.md`, incl. `--verify-hash` / `--cross-check`); multi-block gate files are split per `artifact:` and `--artifact` selects the block — an earlier block's FAIL can no longer be masked by a later PASS; multiple blocks without `--artifact` fail loudly. `_TEMPLATE.GATE.md` documents this.
- **`check_response_coverage.py`:** citation-shaped brackets (`[12]`, `[3-5]`, `[EVID:id]`) are no longer treated as placeholders — rebuttals citing literature pass.
- **Minor:** `check_abstract.py` half-up rounding; `format_references.py` accepts `author_year_keyword` ids in author-year mode (docs aligned: `evidence_guide.md` v0.3.1); `compile_response_docx.py` no longer rewrites "# Response to Reviewers" as "Response: to Reviewers"; line numbers after code fences correct in `check_citations` / `check_numbers` / `check_coverage`; `check_coverage.py` counts markdown-table rows separately; `check_abbreviations.py` allowlist matches `COVID-19` via stem; `lint_manuscript.py` catches italic `*p* = .02` and stops flagging "group = 30".
- Tests 262 → 295.

### v1.6.3 (2026-07-02)

**Mechanical submission-error checkers (advisory-first)**

- **`scripts/check_crossrefs.py`** — verifies in-text "Table N"/"Figure N" mentions against the actual `table_*.md` files and figure-legend entries: broken references (the desk-reject trigger nothing else caught), unreferenced tables/figures, and out-of-order first mentions. Handles "Tables 1 and 2", "Figure 2-4", "Fig. 1A"; ignores code fences/HTML comments; skips a kind loudly instead of flagging everything when its inventory is missing. Advisory by default; `--fail-on-broken` / `--fail-on-unreferenced` / `--fail-on-order` to gate.
- **`scripts/check_abbreviations.py`** — define-at-first-use audit with abstract and body as independent scopes (journals require both). Emits `ABBREV_UNDEFINED` / `ABBREV_DEFINED_AFTER_USE` / `ABBREV_REDEFINED` / always-advisory `ABBREV_SINGLE_USE`. Deliberately advisory — detection is capitals-only (2-6 letters, `-digits`, plural `s`) with a built-in statistical allowlist (CI, SD, OR, HR, ...) extendable via `--allow`; `--strict` gates definition issues only.
- **`scripts/check_response_coverage.py`** — the opposite face of the ghost-revision gate: did the response letter answer **every** reviewer comment? Parses the `Reviewer #N:` / `Comment N)` / `Response:` structure, blocks missing/empty/`[placeholder]` responses, and with `--comments` cross-checks the original reviewer_comments file (`COMMENT_UNANSWERED` fails; unparseable original warns, `--strict` fails). Fails by default — a skipped comment is binary.
- Design principle per author feedback: mechanization only for binary facts; judgment stays human+LLM. Docs updated (`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/qc_guide.md` §3.7/§4.2, `docs/revision_guide.md`). 40 tests (262 total).

### v1.6.2 (2026-07-02)

**Abstract Keywords enforced**

- The `**Keywords:**` line at the bottom of `drafts/02_abstract.md` was easy to miss (no lint, no explicit rule). Three-layer enforcement: (1) the template now names the requirement and gives an example, (2) `docs/writing_guide.md` § 02. Abstract lists a Keywords rule (3-6 MeSH-preferred terms, semicolon-separated), and (3) `scripts/lint_manuscript.py` detects abstract files and emits `KEYWORDS_MISSING` / `KEYWORDS_EMPTY` / `KEYWORDS_TOO_FEW` / `KEYWORDS_TOO_MANY` — the PostToolUse `lint_on_edit` hook already surfaces lint on edits, so an empty Keywords line is now caught the moment the abstract is touched. Semicolon and comma separators both counted. 7 tests (222 total).

### v1.6.1 (2026-06-30)

**`/editor-review` uses the same reviewer picker as `/critical-review`**

- The editorial desk-screen now offers the identical model-selection UX as `/critical-review`: an `AskUserQuestion` reviewer picker over the same pool — the four OpenRouter models (`scripts/critical_models.txt`) + local Claude + Codex — only the role differs (`--role editor`, prompt `editor.txt`). Selecting just `Claude` gives the single Opus subagent (no key). Codex is orchestrated via `codex:codex-rescue` (it is not a `critical_review.py` model — that script handles OpenRouter + local Claude). Command + protocol §5 updated; also fixes the ja/zh README headers that were left at v1.5.10 while their changelog already listed v1.6.0.

### v1.6.0 (2026-06-29)

**Editorial desk-screen — high-impact-journal editor assessment (`/editor-review`)**

- A new evaluation that goes beyond mechanical QC and reviewer-level critique: an **Editor-in-Chief / Clinical Editor desk-screen at the high-impact tier**. It identifies the manuscript's own field, benchmarks the paper against what that field's high-impact journals actually publish, and judges **clinical validity** (practice-changing? MCID/effect, not just p?), **scope/novelty fit**, and **methodological/analytic adequacy** — then returns a `SEND FOR PEER REVIEW` / `BORDERLINE` / `DESK REJECT` verdict with the concrete **additional validation needed to compete**, or a realistic lower-tier journal if the bar is out of reach.
- Canonical prompt `scripts/critical_prompts/editor.txt` (single source). Runs as a single Opus subagent (no API key) **or** a multi-model panel via `scripts/critical_review.py --role editor`; optional medical-kag / PubMed benchmark of the real high-impact literature. Exposed as `/editor-review`; documented in `docs/critical_review_protocol.md` §5. Advisory (judgment-based) — does not replace the grounded gates. Tests added.

### v1.5.10 (2026-06-28)

**Test-coverage hardening, round 2 (MEDIUM gaps)**

- Added tests for the remaining coverage gaps from the full review: `search_pubmed.py` pure formatters (`format_citation` author-count branches, `guess_study_design` ladder); `check_abstract.py` (abstract more precise than body → fail, integer match, multi-file body aggregation, comparator preserved in the issue); `check_numbers.py` (p-value `>` comparator pass/fail, `is_structural_number` for heading/`Table N`/`Figure N`/bare-year); `check_style.py` (`mean_sentence_length`/`paragraph_count` tolerance, `split_sentences` abbreviation/decimal protection); `check_citations.py` (`require_citations`, `fail_abstract_only` toggles); `format_references.py` (`smith_2020a` disambiguation, `--convert` write path); `check_coverage.py` (`--fail-on-unrealized`). 214 tests total (was 170).

### v1.5.9 (2026-06-28)

**Test-coverage hardening on enforcement paths**

- A full-review coverage analysis found that several *enforcement contracts* had no test, so a regression could silently disable them. Added tests for: `verify_all.py` top-level `OVERALL: PASS` verdict and its `--cross-check` (+ `--evidence`/`--results`) pass-through to `check_gate.py`; `check_coverage.py` exit codes for `--fail-on-over-citation` / `--fail-on-unknown` / `--fail-on-uncited-verified` (advisory-by-default vs blocking); and `check_revision_claims.py` `--strict` escalation (a missing original section is a warning by default, a failure under `--strict`). 170 tests total (was 163).

### v1.5.8 (2026-06-28)

**Unify the `[EVID:id]` regex (full-review consistency fix)**

- `extract_claims.py` defined its own permissive `[EVID:([^\]]+)]` pattern while `check_citations.py` (and the scripts that reuse it — `check_coverage.py`, `format_references.py`) use the restrictive `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+`. Valid slugified ids match both identically, but the drift meant a malformed tag could be extracted yet not validated/converted. `extract_claims.py` now imports the canonical `EVID_RE` from `check_citations.py`, so all four scripts share one source of truth. No behavior change for valid ids; 163 tests green.

### v1.5.7 (2026-06-28)

**Bug fixes from a full code audit**

- **Gate cross-check now fails on any live FAIL** (`check_gate.py`) — previously, if a cross-checked dimension failed the live re-run *and* the ledger also recorded FAIL, the gate treated that as "consistent" and did not add a failure, so a broken artifact could still pass when the dimension was not also a `--require-check`. A live deterministic failure now always fails the gate, regardless of the ledger.
- **Plan-first hook no longer fails open on a relative cwd** (`hooks/enforce_gates.py`, `hooks/lint_on_edit.py`) — a relative/missing `cwd` normalized the path to e.g. `drafts/05_results.md` (no leading slash), so the `"/drafts/"` / `"/data/.../py/"` checks did not match and the Rule 7/8 gate was skipped. Paths are now normalized to a leading slash before the check. (Latent: production always sends an absolute cwd.)
- +2 regression tests (163 total).

### v1.5.6 (2026-06-28)

**Abstract↔body number consistency + medical-kag synthesis workflow**

- **`scripts/check_abstract.py`** — checks that every number stated in the abstract also appears somewhere in the body sections (rounding-tolerant), catching the classic reviewer complaint of an abstract-only figure. Complements `check_numbers.py` (which ties numbers to `results/*.csv`); p-value tokens are excluded by default (`--include-p-values` to include). Automates the Abstract↔Methods↔Results↔Tables consistency that Rule 3 / QC Round 1 require. 5 tests.
- **medical-kag synthesis → Discussion/Limitations workflow** (`docs/medical_kag_protocol.md`) — `compare_interventions` / `conflict synthesize` output is rich but noisy (bibliometric outcomes, empty values, KG-normalized names); documents how to filter to clinical outcomes, ground every number/citation, and gate the result, with a Discussion/Limitations skeleton.

### v1.5.5 (2026-06-28)

**CI: run the test suite on every push/PR**

- **`.github/workflows/tests.yml`** — GitHub Actions runs the full pytest suite on pushes to `main` and on pull requests, across Python 3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12, so a change that breaks any verification script is caught before it lands. A status badge is shown at the top of the README.

### v1.5.4 (2026-06-28)

**MCP-independent reference formatter (Phase 7)**

- **`scripts/format_references.py`** — converts drafting-time `[EVID:id]` tags into a submission-ready reference list and in-text citations, reading only `knowledge/evidence.md` (no medical-kag required). Two styles: **numbered** (Vancouver — `[EVID:id]` → `[N]` by first appearance, list numbered in that order) and **author-year** (`(Author, Year)`, alphabetical list). `--convert` writes each section with tags replaced to a sibling `*_formatted.md` (never in place); a cited id absent from evidence.md is left unconverted and reported (and makes the run non-zero). Complements the medical-kag `reference` tool, which stays available when connected. 7 tests (156 total).

### v1.5.3 (2026-06-28)

**Coverage audit refocused on over-citation (not orphan-as-waste)**

- **Over-citation detection** — `check_coverage.py` now flags sentences carrying more than `--max-citations-per-sentence` (default 4) `[EVID:id]` citations (citation stuffing / padding). This and **unknown citations** are the real quality signals; `--fail-on-over-citation` / `--fail-on-unknown` are the meaningful blocking flags.
- **Reframed orphan/uncited as neutral** — an uncited-but-registered reference is normal curation (you cite only what is necessary), **not** wasted work. The prior "verified work unused" framing is removed; uncited refs and unrealized draft_plan items are reported as neutral information. `--fail-on-uncited-verified` / `--fail-on-unrealized` remain only for strict full-use policies and are off by default. Coverage tests now total 8 (149 suite-wide).

### v1.5.2 (2026-06-27)

**Citation coverage / orphan audit**

- **`scripts/check_coverage.py`** — a Phase 6 QC audit against `knowledge/evidence.md`: reports **orphan references** (registered but never cited; verified-but-uncited flagged as wasted work), **citation density** per manuscript section, **unknown citations** (cited but unregistered), and — with `--draft-plan` — **unrealized claims** (planned in the Claim→Citation map but never cited in the body). Advisory by default; `--fail-on-orphan-verified` / `--fail-on-unrealized` / `--fail-on-unknown` make any dimension blocking. Reuses `check_citations.py` parsing so the two stay in lockstep. 7 tests (148 total).

### v1.5.1 (2026-06-26)

**Translated-README documentation-table parity**

- Added the missing File Roles rows to the Korean/Japanese/Chinese READMEs so they match `README.md`: `docs/debate_protocol.md` and `docs/critical_review_protocol.md` (all three), plus `scripts/critical_review.py` (ja/zh). Docs-only; no code change.

### v1.5.0 (2026-06-26)

**Gate cross-check (ledger ↔ live) + doc/version auto-sync policy**

- **Gate cross-check** (`scripts/check_gate.py --cross-check LABEL=PATH`) — re-runs the canonical checker live for the deterministic dimensions (`citation` / `numbers` / `revision_claims`) and fails the gate when the ledger's recorded status disagrees in either direction, catching a stale or fabricated `PASS`; loud-fails when a source is unreachable. Forwarded by `scripts/verify_all.py` and wired into the canonical gate commands (`review/gates/_TEMPLATE.GATE.md`, `docs/verification_protocol.md` v0.3.0, CLAUDE.md). +6 regression tests (141 total).
- **Doc/version sync + auto commit-push policy** (CLAUDE.md Rule 12) — every harness code/bug change now bumps the version, updates the affected docs, and auto-commits/pushes (with explicit STOP conditions for sensitive or destructive cases).

### v1.4.1 (2026-06-24)

**Template-gate hardening + `/verify` freshness forwarding**

- **Template-aware plan gates** — `scripts/hooks/enforce_gates.py` now treats unresolved `analysis_plan.md` / `draft_plan.md` templates or unchecked approval boxes as not approved, applies to `Write|Edit|MultiEdit`, and avoids false positives for legitimate citation-style `[N]` text.
- **Fresh `/verify` gate checks** — `scripts/verify_all.py` now forwards `--verify-hash` to `check_gate.py`; README/CLAUDE/slash-command examples include freshness inputs.
- **Windows/template hygiene** — PubMed command examples use `py scripts\search_pubmed.py`, generated root-level DOCX artifacts are ignored, and regression tests cover the new hook and freshness-forwarding behavior.

### v1.4.0 (2026-06-24)

**Citation stance + evidence comparison table (GraphRAG-backed)**

- **Citation stance** (`/cite-stance [claim|section]`) — classify how each cited source relates to a claim (supporting / contrasting / mentioning) so the Discussion stays balanced; flags "one-sided" when contrasting evidence exists but is not cited (overclaim-by-omission guard). New Citation-Stance verifier (`docs/verifier_prompt_templates.md`); medical-kag `conflict` surfaces missing contrasts, evidence.md fallback. Scite-style, claim-specific.
- **Evidence comparison table** (`/evidence-table [topic|ids]`) — assemble a "summary of included studies" table (study / design / n / intervention / outcome / result / LoE) for the Discussion or a PRISMA supplement. `scripts/evidence_table.py` is the deterministic formatter; medical-kag structured data primary, evidence.md fallback. Elicit-style. Tests added.

### v1.3.0 (2026-06-24)

**Citation assist — suggestion + per-claim verification (GraphRAG-backed)**

- **Citation suggestion** (`/suggest-citation [claim]`) — given a draft claim, retrieve the best `[EVID:id]` candidates via the medical-kag knowledge graph (GraphRAG), falling back to `knowledge/evidence.md` + `scripts/search_pubmed.py` when the MCP is unavailable. The author picks; new sources are registered in evidence.md (PMID/DOI verified) before they become citable, so grounding holds.
- **Per-claim verification report** (`/verify-claims [section]`) — `scripts/extract_claims.py` pulls every `[EVID:id]`-tagged sentence, then the Semantic-Citation Verifier classifies each as SUPPORTED / PARTIAL / UNSUPPORTED into `review/claim_verification.md` (a Phase-6 QC "claim map", deeper than `check_citations.py`'s existence check). New `docs/citation_assist_protocol.md`; both operations degrade gracefully to evidence.md. Tests added.

### v1.2.0 (2026-06-22)

**medical-kag MCP integration — knowledge graph alongside evidence.md**

- **Grounding-preserving KAG integration** — the `medical-kag-remote` MCP (a spine-surgery knowledge-augmented graph) plugs in as an upstream discovery/analysis/format engine, while `knowledge/evidence.md` stays the single canonical citation ledger: anything the graph surfaces is registered as `[EVID:id]` (PMID/DOI verified) before it can be cited, so `check_citations.py` still gates everything. New `docs/medical_kag_protocol.md` maps the tools to phases — discovery + structured extraction (Phase 1), evidence-chain / intervention-comparison / GRADE synthesis for claims + Discussion (Phase 3-4), conflict / overclaim guard (Phase 6), journal-style reference lists (Phase 7).
- **Additive + fallback** — the MCP is never a dependency: if it is unavailable (e.g. an unauthenticated remote session), the workflow degrades to `scripts/search_pubmed.py` + manual evidence.md. Wired into CLAUDE.md (Rule 1, STOP signals, Phase 1, Quick Commands) + AGENTS.MD for Codex parity.

### v1.1.2 (2026-06-21)

**Fix — hooks read UTF-8 stdin (Korean intent on Windows)**

- The `UserPromptSubmit` / `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` hooks now reconfigure stdin to UTF-8. On Windows (cp949 default) the JSON payload Claude Code emits was mis-decoded, so non-ASCII prompts — e.g. the Korean auto-trigger "학술적으로 바꿔줘" — silently failed to match. Added an end-to-end UTF-8 stdin test.

### v1.1.1 (2026-06-21)

**Style enforcement — measurable gate + Codex parity**

- **Deterministic style metrics** — `scripts/check_style.py` (`extract` / `check --spec`) measures word count, mean sentence length, paragraphs, citation density, and hedging, and flags deviations from the Style Spec targets — the "check_numbers for style". Wired into `lint_on_edit.py` (surfaces `[STYLE-METRIC]` deviations on each draft edit when a Style Spec exists) and the Phase 5/6 gates. Tests added.
- **Codex parity + calibration** — `AGENTS.MD` now tells non-Claude runtimes to run the style-pass (`check_style.py` + Style-Conformance verifier) explicitly, since the hooks are Claude Code-only. The Style Spec template gains a before→after calibration example (few-shot steers the transform better than abstract rules).

### v1.1.0 (2026-06-21)

**Style transformation — rough draft → bound journal style, reliably**

- **Style Spec + Style-Conformance Verifier** — bind ONE exemplar (`Style/own/` or `Style/target_journal/`) into a compact, always-loaded `drafts/style_spec.md` (`docs/style_spec_template.md`), then transform section-by-section and verify each section against the spec with an independent **Style-Conformance Verifier** (auto-fix loop, max 2; `docs/verifier_prompt_templates.md` + `verification_protocol.md`). This reaches the holistic style layer (structure, sentence length, hedging, claim strength, reference format) that lint cannot. New `/style-pass` command + `docs/style_transform_protocol.md`.
- **Auto-trigger on intent** — a `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`scripts/hooks/style_intent.py`) detects "make it academic / 학술적으로 바꿔줘" and injects the style-pass protocol, so the transform fires without remembering the command. SessionStart now also surfaces the active Style Spec. Advisory + fail-open. Tests added.

### v1.0.3 (2026-06-20)

**Cross-runtime critical review + model selection**

- **Claude-CLI reviewer** — `scripts/critical_review.py --include-claude` shells out to the local `claude -p` (headless) so a non-Claude-Code caller (Codex or a plain shell) can pull in Claude's adversarial review. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is now only required when an OpenRouter model is actually requested. Documented in `docs/critical_review_protocol.md` + `AGENTS.MD`.
- **Larger model pool + pick ~2** — `scripts/critical_models.txt` now offers MiniMax M3, GLM 5.2, Qwen3-Max, and DeepSeek V4 Pro; `/critical-review` presents them as individual `AskUserQuestion` options and recommends choosing ~2 (cost + blind-spot diversity), then runs `--models <selected>`.

### v1.0.2 (2026-06-20)

**Process enforcement + CLAUDE.md condensation**

- **Plan-first enforcement (hooks)** — `.claude/settings.json` adds committed hooks: a PreToolUse `Write|Edit|MultiEdit` gate (`scripts/hooks/enforce_gates.py`) that BLOCKS drafting a section without a completed/approved `drafts/.../draft_plan.md` (Rule 8) or creating an analysis script without a completed/approved `data/.../analysis_plan.md` (Rule 7), and a SessionStart hook (`scripts/hooks/session_contract.py`) that injects the workflow contract every session. Revisions are exempt; multi-paper subfolders handled; fails open; UTF-8 safe. (Windows `py`; macOS/Linux use `python3`.)
- **`/verify`** — `scripts/verify_all.py` runs check_citations + check_numbers (+ optional check_gate) in one command before recording a gate PASS, and forwards `--verify-hash` to keep documented freshness checks active. Hook and freshness-forwarding behavior is covered by regression tests.
- **CLAUDE.md condensed 808 → 696 lines (~14%)** — collapsed the Multi-Paper/Revision structure trees and the Phase-2 Notes / test-selection / style-priority / gate-placement duplicates into pointers to their canonical docs; no MUST-FOLLOW rule removed.

### v1.0.1 (2026-06-20)

**Post-release hardening + concision tooling**

- **Same-day hardening (code review + project audit)** — `check_gate.py` freshness now fails cleanly on non-file paths (directory/missing) instead of crashing, anchors relative paths on the repo `ROOT`, rejects blank/placeholder digests with a clear message, and reports `provenance_verified` / `provenance_unverified` in PASS output; Phase 8 verifier set aligned (Logic is Draft-only; Revision adds Revision-claims + Response-alignment) with `--require-check constraint` in the gate commands; "3 verifiers" corrected to "4"; Critical Rules renumbered 9/10/11; `lint_manuscript.py` skips nonexistent `.md` arguments (first lint tests added); `check_numbers.py` requires an explicit p-value (not any 0–1 proportion); `search_pubmed.py` evidence entries gain Evidence ID + Source Status; `failure_code` added to checker FAIL output; test suite expanded to 77 tests.
- **Concision Pass** — `docs/writing_guide.md` gains a journal word-limit compression pass (Phase 5): 10 Before→After patterns distilled from a senior English edit, plus an over-compression guardrail (keep primary-outcome definitions, statistical spec, eligibility, and key limitations in text or move to Supplement — never silently delete).

### v1.0.0 (2026-06-20)

**Verification hardening (superpowers-inspired)**

- **Gate freshness / provenance** — `check_gate.py` gains a `provenance:` block (sha256 of artifact/evidence/results), `--verify-hash LABEL=PATH` (fails a gate as *stale* when a verified file changed after PASS), and `--compute-hash PATH`. Closes the stale-PASS hole opened by parallel verification; backward compatible (opt-in flag). `review/gates/_TEMPLATE.GATE.md` and `docs/verification_protocol.md` (v0.2.0) document it; pytest coverage expanded to 70 tests.
- **Parallel verifiers + Constraint-first** — the four section-gate verifiers run concurrently against a frozen artifact; fixes prioritize Constraint (spec) violations; all PASSes are discarded and re-run after any edit (`docs/verification_protocol.md`).
- **STOP signals** — CLAUDE.md anti-rationalization table (§10) guarding the human-level shortcuts verifiers miss.
- **Socratic draft-plan brainstorming** — `docs/draft_plan_template.md` Step 0 (one question at a time; distinct from `/paper-debate`, feeds it as R0 prep), wired into CLAUDE.md Phase 3 + Rule 8.
- **Reviewer-response triage** — `docs/revision_guide.md` accept/partial/rebut posture per comment, tied to `[CHANGE]` + ghost-revision; Phase 8 verifier set aligned to include Constraint.
- **Command `use-when` lines** added to `.claude/commands/*.md`; TodoWrite documented as non-authoritative QC/gate tracking (CLAUDE.md Rule 4).

### v0.9.3 (2026-06-19)

**Co-author collaboration and multi-model critical review**

- Added **`/paper-debate`** (`docs/debate_protocol.md`, `.claude/commands/paper-debate.md`) — pre-writing Claude–Codex co-author debate for analysis plans, draft plans, argument structure, and reviewer responses; bounded rounds with consensus cap 3, debate logs under `review/debates/`, Claude-solo fallback.
- Added **`/critical-review`** (`docs/critical_review_protocol.md`, `.claude/commands/critical-review.md`) — post-writing adversarial review by any combination of a fresh Claude subagent, Codex, and OpenRouter models (default `minimax/minimax-m3`, `z-ai/glm-5.2`), merged and ranked by consensus × severity, reports under `review/critical/`.
- Added `scripts/critical_review.py` (OpenRouter caller; one model's failure is skipped, not fatal), `scripts/critical_models.txt` (externalized model list), and `scripts/critical_prompts/` (single-source adversarial prompts `manuscript.txt` / `response.txt` shared by the script, the Claude subagent, and Codex).
- Critical-review prompts framed at **senior peer-reviewer / editor-in-chief level** — design soundness, data-to-conclusion support, and publication-worthiness, not just surface defects.
- `build_prompt` uses `str.replace` (not `str.format`) so literal braces (JSON/LaTeX examples) in a prompt or target text cannot crash substitution; regression test added.
- Added **AI-Draft De-bloat** section to `docs/writing_guide.md` — strips AI tells (hollow `-ing` analysis, AI vocabulary, signposting) while excluding legitimately conflicting patterns (hedging/copula/passive).
- OpenRouter access via `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored); absent key skips OpenRouter and proceeds with the other reviewers.
- CLAUDE.md integrates both commands (Collaboration commands, Phase 2/3/4/8 debate prompts, Round 6 two-layer critical review, File Roles, structure trees).

### v0.9.2 (2026-06-18)

**Verification harness hardening** (bug fixes + doc consistency)

- `check_numbers.py`: no longer crashes on percentages (e.g. 42.5%); rejects p-values backed only by an unrelated value (e.g. a count of 0); handles thousands separators (1,234) and ignores ISO dates and inline `code` spans.
- `check_gate.py`: strips inline `# ...` comments so the documented gate template passes and round-overflow escalation works.
- Added `requirements.txt` (python-docx) and a `tests/` pytest suite (run with `pytest`).
- Docs: verifier set corrected to Constraint / Citation / Data / Logic (Revision adds Revision-claims and Response-alignment); response compiler description corrected (it reproduces formatting, it does not read a reference .docx).

### v0.9.1 (2026-06-18)

**Multilingual README and Author Response DOCX Completion**

- Synchronized English, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese READMEs with the verification harness scripts and DOCX response workflow.
- Added Author response Markdown template documentation and `compile_response_docx.py` usage.

### v0.9.0 (2026-06-16)

**Verification Harness** — inline produce→verify→fix→re-verify gates (new `docs/verification_protocol.md`)

- Inline verification gates after each produce step (Phase 3/4/8) — replaces end-loaded manual QC with a produce→verify→fix→re-verify loop
- Verifier subagents: Constraint (instruction compliance), Citation (citation grounding vs evidence.md), Data (numbers vs results CSV), Logic (cross-section logic/redundancy); the Revision gate adds Revision-claims and Response-alignment
- Autonomous fix loop (max 2 retries) then user escalation
- `[EVID:author_year]` citation tags and results-CSV-as-single-source grounding
- Gate ledger (`review/gates/`) blocks progress until `status: PASS` is recorded
- `evidence.md` entries gain a Source Status field; Phase 6 QC lightened to a final-confirmation pass
- Programmatic citation checker: `py scripts\check_citations.py drafts\03_introduction.md --evidence knowledge\evidence.md`
- Programmatic number checker: `py scripts\check_numbers.py drafts\05_results.md drafts\table_1.md --results results`
- Programmatic phase gate checker: `py scripts\check_gate.py review\gates\phase_04_draft.GATE.md --artifact drafts\05_results.md --require-check constraint --require-check citation --require-check numbers --require-check logic --verify-hash artifact=drafts\05_results.md`
- Programmatic ghost-revision checker: `py scripts\check_revision_claims.py drafts\revision\REV1\response_letter_REV1.md --strict`
- LLM semantic verifier schema: `docs/verifier_prompt_templates.md` for logic, redundancy, semantic citation support, and revision-response alignment

### v0.8.1 (2026-06-16)

**Response Letter Formatting Rules** — `docs/revision_guide.md` internal version v0.3.0 → v0.4.0

- Reworked the response letter format to a minimal-formatting standard:
  - Bold only the words **"Comment x.x"** and **"Response"**; all other formatting removed (no headings, colors, indentation, tables, or bullet/numbered lists)
  - Quoted revised manuscript text is set in *italic*
  - Responses are written as prose (no numbered/itemized points), flowing thanks → position → rationale → action in a single paragraph
  - Revision locations use lead-in placement — state the location first, then quote the revised text (no trailing "(See ...)")
  - No hyphens or em-dashes
  - Persuasive, reviewer-convincing tone
- Added a **minimal change principle** for manuscript edits — make only the smallest sentence changes needed to address each comment, keeping revisions concise rather than verbose
- Updated the "during writing" checklist to match the new formatting rules

### v0.8.0 (2026-06-16)

**Style Workflow, Linting, and Agent Instructions**

- Promoted writing-style material into the top-level `Style/` workflow, separate from reference evidence under `knowledge/`.
- Added `Style/style_guide.md` for style-anchor extraction rules, PDF-to-MD mirror rules, and publisher generic filename handling.
- Expanded `Style/terminology.md` into the project terminology registry for preferred/forbidden terms across spine surgery, trials, AI/radiomics, and reporting contexts.
- Added `docs/drafting_protocol.md` and `docs/section_templates.md` to enforce outline → evidence-bound draft → style pass → QC drafting.
- Added `scripts/lint_manuscript.py` and updated draft/table templates so manuscript linting passes with `py scripts/lint_manuscript.py drafts --quiet` on Windows.
- Added `AGENTS.MD` as agent bootstrap instructions, with `CLAUDE.md` as the authoritative source of truth.
- Updated `.gitignore` so copyrighted PDFs and private style-anchor summaries remain local, while public workflow files and examples remain commit-eligible.

### v0.7.1 (2026-05-15)

**Terminology & Template**
